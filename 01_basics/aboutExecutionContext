Whenever a function is called, its execution context is created, which consists of its local data and lexical environment. Is this statement is correct?

Yes, the statement is mostly correct, but let's clarify it with proper terms:

âœ… Corrected Statement:
Whenever a function is called, a new execution context is created, which consists of:

Local variables / arguments (Local Environment)

Lexical environment (where the function was defined, not called)

Scope chain

this binding

Reference to outer environment

âœ… Explanation (in simple terms):
When a function is called, JavaScript creates an execution context for it.

This includes:

Local data: variables, arguments inside the function.

Lexical environment: the surrounding scope where the function was defined, not where it was called.

this context: based on how the function is called.

ðŸ§  Bonus: Execution Context Types in JS
Global Execution Context (created once)

Function Execution Context (created every time a function runs)

Eval Execution Context (rarely used)

So yes, your original statement is mostly correct, just needs slight technical clarification.
