//here we are learning defining of varibale in javascipt
//const var and let are keyword used to define variable
//varible is container that store different type of data


//in javascipt we can define data without using any varible keyword 
school="gvs";//also works but not to use

const name="manoj";//varible defined with const cannot be changed in future give error if you try to do so
let rollNo=123;
var college="Lnct";

//prefer not to use var because it has function scope and block scope
console.table([name,rollNo,college]);
//method to show varible data in table form
