//innerText and textContent are display the text inside element with text content also display hidden text

//document.querySelector('input[type="password"]);

//nodeList is returned when we apply qyerySelectorAll on h1
//to change property 
const myNodeList=document.querySelectorAll('h1');
//to iterate or change property of nodeList nodeList[0],[1]...will be used

//nodelist has not property map
//htmlcollection has not property forEach and map
//first conevet it into array by Array.from(htmlcollection || nodeList);


//parent.children give html collection to traverse
//by children we can go to parent by parentElement


//parent.childNodes give nodelist (collection with text div line break...)



//we are creating a function to create element
